## About

Unpackrr is a powerful graphical application for managing Bethesda Archive 2 (BA2) files used in Fallout 4 and Fallout 76. It automatically extracts small BA2 archives to help you stay under the game's BA2 file limit (typically 255 files), preventing crashes and improving mod compatibility.

**This is a Rust port** of the [original Python-based Unpackrr](https://github.com/kazum1kun/ba2-batch-unpack-gui) by [KazumaKuun](https://github.com/kazum1kun), rewritten for:
- **Better Performance**: Native compilation and async I/O for faster processing
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Rust's memory safety prevents crashes
- **Modern UI**: Fluent Design interface with light/dark themes
- **Cross-Platform Readiness**: Built with portability in mind

**Original Author**: KazumaKuun / Southwest Codeworks
**Current Maintainer**: [evildarkarchon](https://github.com/evildarkarchon)
**License**: GPL-3.0 (application), MPL-2.0 (bundled BSArch.exe)

## Technical Details

### Architecture

Unpackrr is built on:
- **Rust 2024 Edition** - Modern, safe systems programming
- **Slint UI Framework** - Declarative, hardware-accelerated GUI
- **Tokio Async Runtime** - Concurrent I/O operations
- **BSArch.exe** - Battle-tested BA2 extraction (MPL-2.0 licensed)

**Key Technologies**:
- `async-compat` - Slint + Tokio integration
- `reqwest` - Update checking via GitHub API
- `tracing` - Comprehensive logging
- `serde` - Configuration serialization
- `regex` - Advanced file filtering
- `rayon` - Parallel BA2 scanning

### BSArch.exe

This application uses [BSArch.exe](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit) for BA2 extraction. BSArch is a mature, reliable tool developed by the TES5Edit team, licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0).

**Why not reimplement extraction in Rust?**
- BSArch.exe is years ahead in terms of BA2 format support and edge case handling
- It's actively maintained and updated for new Bethesda game releases
- Focus our efforts on user experience rather than reinventing the wheel
- MPL-2.0 license permits redistribution with proper attribution

### File Selection Logic

A BA2 file is extracted if it meets **all** of these criteria:
1. Contains at least one postfix from the "Postfixes" list
2. Does **not** contain any pattern from the "Ignored Files" list
3. Is smaller than the specified threshold (if set)

**Regex Support**:
Wrap patterns in curly braces for regex matching:
- `{.*[dD]iamond.*}` - Matches files containing "diamond" or "Diamond"
- `{^Texture.*Main\.ba2$}` - Matches files starting with "Texture" and ending with "Main.ba2"

**Note**: Regex patterns use `fullmatch()`, meaning they're anchored at start and end (`^pattern$`).

## Configuration

Settings are stored in JSON format at:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Unpackrr\config\config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/unpackrr/config/config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.unpackrr.app/config/config.json`

Logs are stored at:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Unpackrr\logs\`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/unpackrr/logs/`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.unpackrr.app/logs/`

Log files rotate daily: `unpackrr-YYYY-MM-DD.log`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start**:
- Ensure `BSArch.exe` is in the same directory as `unpackrr.exe`
- Check logs in the data directory for detailed error messages
- Try running from command line to see startup errors

**Extraction fails**:
- Verify BA2 files aren't corrupted using the Check Files screen
- Ensure you have write permissions to the mod folder
- Check that BSArch.exe is not blocked by antivirus software

**Performance issues**:
- Large mod collections (1000+ BA2s) may take time to scan
- Enable logging to identify bottlenecks
- Consider using manual threshold instead of Auto for huge collections

### Reporting Bugs
